                    <p>BountyDo is a task management application. After registration, you will have the following options: • Hello, productive day! Create and edit tasks, specifying the title, special tag (related to the field of activity), description and
                        time.
                        <p>• Not to forget! If among your tasks there are those that need to be completed right now, then you can make them a priority by clicking on the star so as not to lose them.</p>
                        <P>• I completed the task! When the task is completed, click on the “Сomplete!” button. This task will disappear, and the counter of completed tasks will increase by +1.</P>
                        <p> • I don 't need this task anymore! If you just want to delete an unnecessary task - click on the “Delete” button. The completed tasks counter will not increase. </p>
                        <p>• There was not enough time yesterday! If you did not complete the previous day's tasks, you will receive a warning that you probably forgot to complete/delete them, so they are carried over to the current day marked “Expired task”.
                            And then you yourself choose whether to delete them or complete them today.</p>
                        <p> • Gather a collection of unique pets! This feature of the app is designed to motivate you to complete more tasks in a day and collect a whole collection of animals! </p>
                        <p>• Help with finding your tasks! If your list of tasks for the day is too long - use filters for tags or search by name to save time. </p>
